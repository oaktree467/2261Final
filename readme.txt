Milestone 2

Core gameplay has been implemented.
Player can walk between two different maps and
interact with the sprites within each.

Pressing A while a sprite is visible will
activate a second background. Eventually this background
will have text written to it, but for now it
is a blank message box.

Pressing the Gameboy 'R' button while in the living room or kitchen
will allow the player to proceed to the next game state,
as the extensive logic that goes with checking the player has completed
all tasks has not yet been written. This is a temporary feature.

If a player collides with a certain color on the collision map,
the respective sprite will be activated.
